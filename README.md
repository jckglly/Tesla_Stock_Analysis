# Tesla_Stock_Analysis

This was a project completed using Python and a Jupyter Notebook. 

The aim of this project was to gain an insight into the trends of the Tesla's Stock as time has progressed. 

Once the data was collected, I began to look at the fluctuations in daily, weekly and monthly intervals. 

I used a time series to complete this analysis which was done when initially collecting the data.

I transformed certain features present so I could begin analysing:
- the Range of the Stock over these intervals
- the Daily Returns.
